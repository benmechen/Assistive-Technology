/**
 Automatically discover, connect and communicate with a server comforming to the **Assistive Technology Communication Protocol** (`astv`)
 This is based on UDP, however implements some TCP-like features to improve the connection resilience & feedback:
    * When a packet is sent to the server, the server must reply with an acknowledgement response.
    * If this acknowledgement is not received within the specified threshold (2 seconds), the strength is marked as 0. This will bring the average strength of the last 5 values down. Once the average strength is below the specified threshold (5%), the service will assume the connection has failed and will close the connetion.
    * All protocol messages relating to connecting to the server (Bonjour discovery, `discover` packets) expect a response back from the server - if the service is not discovered or a response is not received, the system will try again for a maximum of 5 seconds (Bonjour) or 5 sends (`discover`).
        * If either time out, the connection will be marked as `failed`
    * When the connection is closed, either on the client (iOS) side or server (PC) side, each will send one last dying message to the other (`disconnect`). This will shut down the other member, closing both open connections and allowing each to accept a new connection, so that they are not stuck being bound to a dead connection.
 
 Caller must conform to the ConnectionServiceDelegate protocol to receive status updates
 
 To use the service, either call the `connect(to host: String, on port: UInt16)` function to open a UDP connection with the server on the specified IP and port, or use the `discover(type: String)` function to automatically discover the server using Bonjour and connect to it, using the resolved host and default port 1024.
 To automatically discover the server, it must be
 advertising on the local mDNS network with the same name and type as supplied to the `discover(type: String)` function. If the service cannot find the server's advertisement within 5 seconds, the service will abort the search and return a `failed` state.
