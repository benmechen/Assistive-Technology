#  Team 30 - Assistive Technology iOS Client Reference

This is the reference documentation for the iOS app component of the Assistive Technology project.

Each class has an overview describing, in general terms, what that class/protocol/enum does.
Each important function and variable inside those classes are also documented.
This can all be viewed in the side bar on the left.
